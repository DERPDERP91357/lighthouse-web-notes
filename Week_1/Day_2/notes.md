# Notes

## Git
- git branch -M main
- git remote -v
- git add * 

- git push -u origin main
(permanently pushes to main)


## Commits
- specify how and what is thinks 
- significant change; ie new function
- do not one big commit

- git checkout branch(old commits) - temp checking master/main content

- git reset --hard (7 digits): reset to older version


## DEMO
- edge case: out of ordinary 
- try console log after each step to remove bugs as you go
- NaN / typeof for checking number
  - NaN has type number; hence isNaN is used to do boolean check
- return: a value and also stops further code; can be used but not best practice
- better to use process.exit();

- functions should only do one thing;
